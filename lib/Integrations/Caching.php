 * Class Caching

 * Handles flushing the cache for a set of popular plugins when child page is saved.
 *
 * The following plugins are supported:
 * - WP Rocket
 * - WP Fastest Cache
 * - W3 Total Cache
 *
 * Sometimes child pages are appended to their parent pages. They have their own permalink, but are never displayed
 * directly. Because they are displayed only when the parent page is accessed, their content is also saved inside the
 * parentâ€™s cache.
 *
 * When the child page is saved, the cache for the parent persists. We need to tell the caching plugins that they
 * should always flush caches when child pages are saved or even better: flush the cache of the parent page when a
 * child page is saved.
